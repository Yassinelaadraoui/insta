<h1>Instagram Client app</h1>

I made this client app using cordova and angular, the design of the app is the same as the real instagram and it includes all the feathers such as uploading an image, hashtags, filters, messages, search, follow and more.

This is a mobile app so it runs using cordova/ionic

this folder only contains the front-end side of the project. the backend or the server side can be found in this folder :https://github.com/Yassinelaadraoui/server-for-insta
